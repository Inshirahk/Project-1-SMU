# Abstract
Background
      This project explores the relationship between recreational technology use—specifically social media and gaming—and mental health. We sought to answer the following questions:

      Does social media use negatively impact mental health?
      Is the impact different depending on age? gender?
      Do hours spent on social media correlate negatively with mental health scores?
      Do hours spent on gaming correlate negatively with mental health?


Methods
      We analyzed a dataset of 1,000 individuals, examining daily technology usage and mental health indicators. The dataset contained the following columns:

                  User_ID: Unique identifier for each individual
                  Age: Participant’s age
                  Gender: Participant’s gender
                  Technology_Usage_Hours: Combined total hours of technology use
                  Social_Media_Usage_Hours: Hours spent daily on social media
                  Gaming_Hours: Hours spent daily gaming
                  Screen_Time_Hours: Total daily screen time
                  Mental_Health_Status: A self-reported scale (1 = Excellent, 4 = Poor)
                  Stress_Level: Self-reported stress levels
                  Sleep_Hours: Average daily sleep hours
                  Physical_Activity_Hours: Hours of physical activity
                  Support_Systems_Access: Access to social and emotional support
                  Work_Environment_Impact: Perceived impact of work environment on mental health
                  Online_Support_Usage: Use of online resources for emotional support
                  
Hypotheses
      Alternative Hypothesis: Social media use negatively impacts mental health.
      Null Hypothesis: Social media use has no impact or positively influences mental health.
      
Results
Key Findings
Social Media Usage:
      A weak negative correlation was found between social media usage and mental health scores. Individuals with higher usage hours tended to report slightly poorer mental health.

Gaming Hours:
      A weak positive correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.177) was identified between gaming hours and poorer mental health, with a statistically significant p-value (< 0.001).

Age-Based Trends:
      Younger individuals, particularly teens and young adults, exhibited the highest usage hours for both social media and gaming. These groups also reported higher stress levels.

Gender Differences:
      Males consistently demonstrated higher combined usage hours, especially in the "Poor" mental health category.

# Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that excessive recreational technology use—especially among younger individuals—can correlate with poorer mental health. However, the weak correlations indicate that other factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, support systems) likely play more significant roles. Further research is needed to determine causality and develop effective interventions
